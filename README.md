## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The ground_clearance, vehicle_weight, and mpg variables provide a non-random amount of variance while AWD and spoiler_angle produce random amounts of variance.

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope cannot be considered to be at zero due to the P-value = 6.7Ã—10<sup>-11</sup> which is less than the 0.05 significance level.

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The R-squared is equivalent to 71.2% which means the model will predict the mpg values 71.2% of the time. While this is high and does mean the regression has high efficacy in the prediction of mpg, 38.8% of the time it will not predict the values correctly which is likely due to other factors involving the sample size.

#### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

#### Statistical Study
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
