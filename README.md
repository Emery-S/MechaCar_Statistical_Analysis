## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The ground_clearance, vehicle_weight, and mpg variables provide a non-random amount of variance while AWD and spoiler_angle produce random amounts of variance.

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope cannot be considered to be at zero due to the P-value = 6.7Ã—10<sup>-11</sup> which is less than the 0.05 significance level.

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The R-squared is equivalent to 71.2% which means the model will predict the mpg values 71.2% of the time. While this is high and does mean the regression has high efficacy in the prediction of mpg, 38.8% of the time it will not predict the values correctly which is likely due to other factors involving the sample size.
